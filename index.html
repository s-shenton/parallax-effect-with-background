      <h1>Few-shot prompting</h1>
      <p>With few-shot prompting, you give the AI a few examples of the kind of response you want so it can learn the pattern.</p>
      <p class="how-to-use">How to use it:</p>
      <p>Let's say you're writing short summaries of customer support tickets. You give the model a couple of examples showing how each ticket is turned into a simple summary. Then you upload a new ticket and ask it to do the same.</p>

      <h1>Chain of thought prompting</h1>
      <p>In chain of thought prompting, you ask the AI to explain its thinking step by step instead of leaping straight to an answer. This leads to more logical, thoughtful responses — especially for tasks that involve planning or calculations.</p>
      <p class="how-to-use">How to use it:</p>
      <p>Simply add the phrase "think step by step" to your prompt, and see the difference in output.</p>

      <h1>Self-consistency prompting</h1>
      <p>Have you ever asked an AI model the same question multiple times and received different answers? Self-consistency prompting involves doing exactly this — asking the same question several times, then comparing the responses to find the most consistent or reliable one.</p>
      <p class="how-to-use">How to use it:</p>
      <p>Let’s say you're trying to decide if a change to your product is risky. You ask the AI, “Is this a high-risk change? Think it through step by step.” If three out of five answers agree it is, you can feel more confident in that result.</p>

      <h1>Automatic prompt engineering</h1>
      <p>Automatic prompt engineering is a way to automate the prompt-writing process by asking the AI to generate prompts for you. This is helpful when you’re not sure how to phrase a request, or want to explore multiple ways to get better results. It’s usually an iterative process: the model generates several prompt options, and you test or refine the best ones.</p>
      <p class="how-to-use">How to use it:</p>
      <p>Instruct the AI to write you a few possible prompts for a certain task, then evaluate and tweak the best one. For example, "I’m building a prompt to extract action items from meeting notes. Generate 5 possible prompts that would help with that."</p>
